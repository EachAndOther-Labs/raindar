## About the Raindar

Ciarán Harris conceived and built the original Raindar as a tool to quickly let him see if he could avoid getting wet on a motorcycle journey.

Since 2008 a steady stream of friends & colleagues used the tool. Despite more comprehensive tools being available, the Raindar's simplicity & single mindedness proved important.

With version 2 of the Raindar, we strove to keep its simpilicity whilst enhancing its functionality, to allow zooming and panning of the map. We've also widened the rain radar feeds to cover Britain.

Ciarán, Mario, Nick & Amanda at iQ Content did this exploration as part of iQ Labs.
